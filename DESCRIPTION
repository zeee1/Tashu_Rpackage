    Functions on this package interacts with data on 'tashudata' package, a 'drat' repository.
    'tashudata' package contains rental/return history on public bicycle system('Tashu'), weather for 3 years and bicycle station information.

    top10_stations(), top10_paths() function visualizes image showing the most used top 10 stations and paths.
    daily_bike_rental() and monthly_bike_rental() shows daily, monthly amount of bicycle rental.
    create_train_dataset(), create_test_dataset() is data processing function for prediction.
    Bicycle rental history from 2013 to 2014 is used to create training dataset and that on 2015 is for test dataset.
    Users can make random-forest prediction model by using create_train_model() 
    and predict amount of bicycle rental in 2015 by using predict_bike_rental().
